## WHAT

Image processor that outputs responsive image sets to use with _srcset_

Currently using:

- [gulp-sharp-responsive](https://github.com/khalyomede/gulp-sharp-responsive)

- [gulp-responsive](https://github.com/mahnunchik/gulp-responsive)

- [gulp-rename](https://github.com/hparra/gulp-rename)

- [del](https://github.com/sindresorhus/del)

- [change-case-all](https://github.com/btxtiger/change-case-all)

## NOTE

_Note:_ gulp-responsive depends on [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp). Sharp is one of the fastest Node.js modules for resizing JPEG, PNG, WebP and TIFF images.
